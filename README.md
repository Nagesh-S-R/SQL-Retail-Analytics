# SQL-Retail-Analytics
This repository features a well-organized set of SQL scripts designed for comprehensive data analysis and exploration within relational databases. Each script targets a specific analytical objective—from examining database structure and summarizing business metrics to identifying trends over time, ranking performance, and segmenting customers or products.

These queries serve as practical tools for data analysts and BI professionals to quickly generate insights, monitor performance, and make data-driven decisions. The scripts follow clean SQL practices, leveraging powerful features like window functions, aggregations, and conditional logic to solve real-world analytical problems efficiently.

Perfect — here’s the **GitHub-friendly `README.md` section** for listing all the SQL concepts and functions you’ve used, cleanly formatted and ready to include:
